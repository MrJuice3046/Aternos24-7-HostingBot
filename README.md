# Aternos24/7-HostingBot

A Minecraft bot that helps keep an **Aternos server online** by automatically joining it using a **Mineflayer-based bot**.
Useful for **SMPs** or **small multiplayer servers** that shut down when no players are online.

## Features

* Automatically connects to your Aternos server
* Prevents AFK kicks
* Optional auto-auth support
* Chat logging and automated messages
* Auto-reconnect if the bot disconnects
* **Compatible with Paper servers and servers with plugins (Spigot,Bukkit,Purpur)**

## Requirements

* Node.js (v16+ recommended)
* A Minecraft Java account
* An Aternos server
* **A hosting service to run the bot 24/7 (Render recommended)**

## Hosting

To keep the bot online at all times, you must run it on a **hosting service**.

**Recommended hosting:**

* **Render** (Node.js support, simple setup, reliable uptime)

Other compatible hosting providers may also work.

## Configuration Notes

* The bot stays connected to prevent the server from going offline
* Incorrect configuration may cause connection issues
* This bot does **not bypass Aternos limits**, it only keeps the server active

If you want, I can also tweak it to **emphasize plugin support even more**, so server owners immediately see it works with mods and Paper servers. Do you want me to do that?
